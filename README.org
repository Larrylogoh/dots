* Larrylogoh's dots[WIP]
Use at your own risk.

** How to use
...
Clone it and put the files where they belong.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/Larrylogoh/dots
#+END_SRC
Or use pulldots.sh in .local/scripts.
That sets up a git bare repository as well, which is how I prefer to handle my dotfiles.

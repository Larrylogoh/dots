* Larrylogoh's dots[WIP]
Use at your own risk.

** How to use
Clone it and put the files where they belong.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/Larrylogoh/dots
#+END_SRC
Or use pulldots.sh in .local/scripts.
That sets up a git bare repository as well, which is how I prefer to handle my dotfiles.
** Programs I use
- Browser - firefox
- Hotkey daemon - sxhkd
- Music player - cmus
- Notification daemon - dunst
- Terminal emulator - [[https://github.com/Larrylogoh/dwm][st]]
- Text Editor - vim, GNU emacs
